Place your site logo image in this folder and name it `mamma-logo.png` (or update the import path in `Navbar.jsx`).

You can also use a different filename; just update the import accordingly:

```js
import logo from '../assets/your-logo-file.png';
```

The logo will be rendered in the navbar with a height of 40px and linked to the homepage.
